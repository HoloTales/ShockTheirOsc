# ShockTheirOSC

Hi, this is a project I made because the solutions that existed werent good enough for me and felt overly complex for what I needed. All this truly does at the moment is take a OSC message from VRChat and send a message to openshock to shock you.

If it is useful for someone, yippie, otherwise, sad.

# Setup
1. [Verify Dotnet 9 is installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
2. Download latest release
3. Open `appsettings.json` and update `Token` and `ShockerIds` with your settings from openshock
4. Update `OscSettings` to the parameters used on your avatar. This supports VRCOSC parameters.
5. Run and hope it works! If you have any feedback please throw them to me!
